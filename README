reorderDelimitedFileName.pl README

Please see the inline comments for a detailed explanation of the logic.

The script takes a file name, prepended with an optional directory, and a comma separated list of numbers. The script breaks up the file name using the "_" delimiter, or an override, and reorders the matched components as per the comma separated list of numbers. N.B. the directory path is excluded. The file is renamed using the reordered components.
 
Options:
 
--file
	Name of the file to be reordered.
--camel
	Name of the file is delimited by camel case (capital letters that must 
	be preserved).
--order 
 	Order of new file name, formatted as a comma separated list of field 
 	numbers.
--delimiter
	Override for the delimiter string, whose default is "_".
--test
	Execute in test mode, only outputting the manipulated file names to 
	STDOUT.
